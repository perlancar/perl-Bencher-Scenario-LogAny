Revision history for Log-Any

** denotes an incompatible change

1.038     2016-02-10 14:15:31-07:00 America/Mazatlan

    - No changes from 1.037

1.037     2016-02-05 20:22:34-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed t/filescreen.t Unicode string tests to use a backwards
      compatible form.  Should fix tests before 5.16.

1.035     2016-02-04 14:47:20-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Changed]

    - The default formatter now replaces a code reference argument with
      the results of calling the code reference ONLY when it is the first
      argument (in place of a format string).  Code references in
      subsequent arguments (to sprintf) are not executed, as this would
      break backwards compatibility.

    [Documented]

    - Noted that repeatedly calling 'set' to set an adapter without calling
      'remove' or using the 'lexically' feature will leak memory.

1.033     2016-02-03 10:32:57-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Added]

    - The default formatter now expands code references.  If the first
      argument is a code reference, it is expanded and returned.  If an
      argument to "sprintf" style formatting is a code reference, it is
      expanded.

    [Changed]

    - The File adapter now opens files with the ":utf8" layer.  It also
      takes a 'binmode' attribute to change the default.

    [Fixed]

    - does_not_contain_ok test adapter function now gives proper
      diagnostic message

    - all diagnostic messages that output the captured log now
      correctly dump the log with pretty formatting

    [Documented]

    - documented the 'proxy_class' argument to `get_logger`

    [~Internal~]

    - Data::Dumper is loaded lazily, to reduce module load times
      for programs that don't need it.

1.032     2015-03-26 17:23:37-04:00 America/New_York

    - no changes from 1.031

1.031     2015-03-26 06:08:17-04:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Fixed]

    - Log::Any::Adapter::Test passed through all constructor arguments,
      which could be fatal when mocking adapters without all key-value
      pairs (like Log::Any::Adapter::File); now this only passes through
      the category and ignores other parameters when used as an
      adapter class override.

1.03      2015-01-01 22:39:41-05:00 America/New_York

    [Changed]

    - Log::Any::Proxy concatenates arguments to basic logging functions
      with a space character before passing them to adapters as a single
      string.  This ensures consistency across adapters that handle
      multiple arguments differently.

1.02      2014-12-28 07:06:49-05:00 America/New_York

    [Fixed]

    - Some adapters relied on Log::Any::Adapter::Util also loading
      Log::Any so this behavior has been restored.

1.01      2014-12-26 22:25:13-05:00 America/New_York

    [Fixed]

    - 'numeric_level' was not exported properly from
      Log::Any::Adapter::Util

1.00      2014-12-25 22:04:13-05:00 America/New_York

    [Added]

    - Logging now goes via a Log::Any::Proxy object instead of directly to
      an adapter. This allows easy customization of the message production.

    - File, Stdout, and Stderr adapters now support a minimum
      log level parameter.

    [Changed]

    - Removed dead code from Log::Any::Adapter::Base; particularly this
      was the formatting code, since this is now handled by
      Log::Any::Proxy.

    [Fixed]

    - File will flock the handle when writing (if flock is avaiable).

    - Won't die if adapters aren't loadable modules as long as they
      provide a constructor.  This allows using private adapters
      defined in another file.

    [Documented]

    - Revised docs for creating adapters

    - Fixed typos and improved docs for Log::Any::Adapter::Util; removed
      stub docs for modules that didn't need it.

    [Deprecated]

    - Deprecated some methods in Log::Any::Adapter::Util

    [Internal]

    - Merged Log-Any and Log-Any-Adapter distributions; reduces code
      duplication and ensures Log::Any and adapter framework stay in sync

    - Eliminates all non-core dependencies (as of Perl 5.8.1), including
      Capture::Tiny, Devel::GlobalDestruction and Guard

  - Eliminate 'subroutine redefined' warning in case Log::Any::Adapter loaded before
    Log::Any::Test

* Implementation
  - Migrate to Dist::Zilla

0.11  Feb 12, 2010

  - Fix Log::Any::Test to support full logging API (aliases and printf methods)

0.07  Dec 7, 2009

  - Depend on Test::Simple rather than Test::More

* Improvements
  - Add Log::Any::Test, to aid in testing code that uses Log::Any

0.06  Oct 31, 2009

* Fixes
  - Implement Log::Any->set_adapter again for backward compatibility with 0.04 and earlier

0.05  Oct 27, 2009

  - ** Strip Log::Any down to a relative minimum, so as to keep it stable and
    unchanging. Move everything else to Log::Any::Adapter.

0.04  Sep 3, 2009

* Fixes
  - Replace Test::Deep::cmp_deeply with an internal version to avoid Test::Deep dependency

0.03  Jul 17, 2009

* Improvements
  - Eliminated extra '::Log' from adapter names, e.g. Log::Any::Adapter::Log::Dispatch is
    now Log::Any::Adapter::Dispatch. The long name was properly descriptive but was making
    me wince every time.

* Fixes
  - Fix logging aliases like warn => warning

* Implementation
  - Eliminate unnecessary Test/InternalOnly.pm class
